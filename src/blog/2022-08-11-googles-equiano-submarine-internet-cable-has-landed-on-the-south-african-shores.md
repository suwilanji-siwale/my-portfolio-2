  shores.

  Starting in Portugal and eventually ending in South Africa, with branches to
  Nigeria, Togo, the islands of St Helena, and Namibia, the 15,000-kilometer
  (9,320-mile) cable is designed to deliver high-speed broadband along the west
  coast of Africa. Its capacity, a whopping 144 terabits per second, is 20 times
  that of the previous cable serving the region and could increase internet
  speeds more than fivefold in some countries.

Equiano is the latest subsea internet cable financed by Google. Starting in Portugal and eventually ending in South Africa, with branches to Nigeria, Togo, the islands of St Helena, and Namibia, the 15,000-kilometer (9,320-mile) cable is designed to deliver high-speed broadband along the west coast of Africa. Its capacity, a whopping 144 terabits per second, is 20 times that of the previous cable serving the region and could increase internet speeds more than fivefold in some countries.

Named after the Nigerian-born 18th century writer and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, the cable could prove life changing for some.

The cable is scheduled to start carrying traffic at the beginning of 2023. According to a report commissioned by Google, Equiano will cause data prices to drop between 16% and 21% in South Africa, Namibia and Nigeria, and in the latter could lead to the creation of 1.6 million jobs, driven by the expansion of the digital economy and peripheral sectors.

"With increased internet access, societies can modernize, people can acquire new skills and knowledge that can open doors to new job opportunities, and businesses and governments can increase productivity and uncover new revenue streams as a result of digital transformation," said Bikash Koley, Google vice president of global networking, in a statement to CNN.
