**Chowdeck (Nigeria)**

Launched in October 2021 by ex-Paystack Principal Engineers; Femi Aluko and Olumide Ojo, and ex-Engineering Lead at Crown Interactive, Lanre Yusuf, Chowdeck is an on-demand food delivery service and marketplace where people can purchase their favourite meals from a wide range of restaurants. Currently based in Lagos, Nigeria, Africa’s most populous city.

Whether local or continental, customers can buy food in a few short steps and have it delivered to their doorstep in under 30 minutes. Chowdeck is on a mission to empower restaurants in Africa to deliver meals to customers anywhere and anytime. Part of our unique offering to the restaurants listed on our marketplace is that we’ll help them grow, and so far, most of the restaurants we work with can boast of this achievement.

Chowdeck has delivered over 60,000 meals in six months in two major (undisclosed) locations in Lagos.
